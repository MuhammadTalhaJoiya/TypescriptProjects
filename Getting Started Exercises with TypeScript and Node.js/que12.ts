// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let name_person=["Talha","ALI","USMAN","UMER"]
for (let index = 0; index < name_person.length; index++) {
    console.log(`Assalam O Alaikum ${name_person[index]},How are you?`)
    
}
