// Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”
export {};
// let Omer:string="“Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”"
// console.log(Omer)
// Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
// let namuser="hamza"
// console.log(namuser.toLowerCase())
// console.log(namuser.toUpperCase())
// function titleCase(namuser:string){
//     return namuser.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+namuser.slice(1,namuser.length)
// }
// console.log(titleCase(namuser))
// console.log(namuser.charAt(0).toUpperCase())
// Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
// Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
// let quote="People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought."
// console.log(`Allama Iqbal once said, “People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought.”`)
// Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.
// let famous_person="Allama Iqbal"
// let quote="People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought."
// let messege=`${famous_person} once said, “${quote}”`
// console.log(messege)
// Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
// let username:string="                       Talha JOiya                       \n Muhammad Talha Abdul Rehman"
// let a:string[]=username.split("\n")
// console.log(a)
// let aftertrim:string[]=a.map((val)=>{
//     return val.trim()
// }) //Map function does not change the origianl array
// console.log(aftertrim.join(" "))
