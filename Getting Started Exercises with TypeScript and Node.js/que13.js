// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
let transport = ["Bike", "Car", "Skateboard", "Cycle"];
console.log(`I would like to own a ${transport[0]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${transport[1]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${transport[2]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${transport[3]}`);
export {};
